            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Glouerye is an arte or crafte to ſhape, and duely to frame an inſtrument or garment for a mans hande, called a gloue. And gramer is a ſcience or conynge to ſpeke wryte or
<pb facs="tcp:5381:28"/>vnderſtande euery ſentence ryghtly accordynge vnto congruite. Nowe I praye you ſe howe we haue hyderto kept this order, in al our intracty of pacience. Fyrſt we ſetforth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> definicion, in dyuers maners. Then (after the due prayſe of pacience) doeth folowe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modites of pacience, as the cauſe why and wherfore pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhulde be lerned and practyſed. The mater (I ſayde) of euery craft or conyng muſt be had, as lether vnto the glouer, or cordiner. Cloth vnto the Tayliour, or Draper. And the .viii. partes of reaſon: vnto gramer. The mater, of pacience: is trouble, vexacion, hurt, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, gref, and loſſe, and theſe or any of them to be in wordly goodꝭ,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>11.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ralium.</note> muſt be excerciſed with Cayne. That is to meane that who wolde be in the ſtate of Abel all pacient: muſt be excerciſed with the trouble or the malyce of Cayne. And in an other place. The vertue of pacience (ſayeth he) is neuer proued in proſperite, but in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is aduerſite. For as golde &amp; ſyluer be tried &amp; fyned in the fyre, ſo be the diſciples of pacience tried &amp; taught in trouble, and aduerſite. Aduerſite than trouble &amp; noyance is the mater wherin pacience is lerned &amp; gotyne. For yf a perſon wolde byleue that he had pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, without trouble, and without great excerciſe ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in: certenly that pacience were but a peynted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience. There is muche difference bytwene a fyre
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5381:28"/>made of wode, cols, or ſuch other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>buſtible mater that wyll ſone or lyghtly brenne. And a fyre peyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wall. And certenly ſo is hyt of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde paciences. For as peynted fyre can not bren you, ſo pacience without trouble can not ꝓue you Trouble than is the mater. Nowe as vnto the doctours, inſtructours / and teachers of pacience: ther be many. For euery thynge that doeth gyue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion vnto pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce maybe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a teacher therof.

Saye, yf there be any perſon that he wyll iuſtly prayſe: I wyll gladly here, but yf ye ſaye yuel by any ꝑſon: I wyl ſtoppe myne eares, that water ne ſuche fylth: ſhall not enter myne eares, water or any wete in the eares: much noyeth, I wyl none receyue. I wyl not here you. What am I the better to here &amp; knowe that an other man is yuel. Muche hurte and ioperdy of ſoule may come therof, but neuer any vertu ne goodnes. Speke vnto the ſelf perſon charitably, yf he wolde ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him. Let vs ſpeke of our owne matters. Let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what account we muſte make for our owne ſynnes, we ſhall not aunſwere for hys. Let vs not therfore ſerche the ſynnes of other perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. but our owne. For what excuſe may we make vnto our lorde, yf we be curious &amp; redy to ſpye and fynde the fautes of other perſons: and no thynge reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber our owne, none ſuerly. Is hyt not a rebuke for a ſtraunger to loke in euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an other mannes houſe where he hathe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5381:94"/>nought to do, yeſſe ſuerly ſyr. And more rebuke is hyt to ſerche an other perſons lyfe or actes. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dydge here ye muſt knowe, that mayſters, ſouereynes, and ſuche perſons as haue charge of people, by any offyce: may (accordynge vnto the ſame) ſerche the actes of other perſons, and they be alſo bounde therto. But not to bachyte them / but rather to refourme them? Well ſyr ſaye you hyt is a pleaſure to the bachyter to tell hys tale / &amp; a pleaſure for me to here hyt, what ſhal I than do be not deceyued man. For all that is gaye: is not golde, ſynne ſemeth ſwete, but hyt is not ſo. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munely, theſe bachyters when they haue ſayde yuel: they be wery of theyr owne ſayng, &amp; oftymes they wyſhe they had not ſo ſayde. For the fere hyt ſhulde come out that they ſayde, and they be rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked therof, and make them ſelfe (as oftyn they do) of theyr fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a foo, and ſo is hyt alſo of the herer that ofte wyſheth he had not cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that cumpeny that day, hit is not therfore pleaſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo frayteth a perſon, and putteth hym to payne. The wyſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth, haſte thou (ſayth he) harde a tale, kepe hyt within thy ſelfe than, and let hyt deye in the. For byleue me, it wyl not breſt ne breke thy bely, what is that to ſaye: Let hyt deye within the, that is (ſayeth chriſoſtome) quenche thou hyt, burye hyt let hyt neuer come forth, ne yet be moued ne ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by any meane of the, but rather blame thou the bachyter, and forgete thou what thou harde / put clene of thy mynde what he ſayde as yf thou
<pb facs="tcp:5381:95"/>had neuer herde ſpeke therof. And ſo ſhalt thou lyue in greate peace and ſuerty, of conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And yf thou vſe to blame the bacbiters, and to thretyn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wyll tell the parties: thou maye perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture vnto thy greate merite: brynge them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cuſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or at the leaſt thou ſhalte make them affrayde to bacbyte in thy preſence. For as well ſaynge, laude &amp; prayſe: is a bygynnynge &amp; nury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhynge of amyte frendſhyppe, and loue: So yuel ſaynge is a bygynnynge of hatred diſcorde and debate. Byd therfore the bachyter loke vpon hym ſelfe, hyt is an yuel thynge for any maner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be curious and byſy about other mennes dedes and to ſerche theyr lyues: and be neglyge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them ſelfe. But the bachyter hathe no leyſer to examyne hym ſelfe ne to ſerche hys owne lyfe: for lokynge vpon other mens. For whyle he gyueth ſo greate diligence vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> curioſite of knowynge vpon others mens dedes: he muſte nede be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of his owne. And that is a greate foly Syth all the tyme a man may haue: is lytel ynogh and to lytle: to ſerche hys owne lyfe, to recounte hys owne ſynnes. And yf he euer be occupied with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens maters: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal he haue leyſer tocure &amp; hede his owne? Beware nowe therfore chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of thys breth.
